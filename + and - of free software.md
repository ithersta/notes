# Freedoms
What is free software? According to the Free Software Foundation, a program is considered free if the program's users have some essential freedoms.
1. Freedom 1 is to study how the program works, and change it however you want. Of course, to do it you need to have access to the source code of the program. Open source code is a necessary condition for free software.
2. Freedom 2 is to redistribute copies if you want and freedom 3 is to distribute modified versions. These two freedoms mean that you are free to share copies of the program, with or without modifications. You can offer them for free or you can sell them. You also have a freedom not to do it if you want your program to stay private.
0. So they had this list of 3 freedoms around 1990s, but then they realized that the it is incomplete and there's one far more important requirement for software to be free. They called it freedom 0. It's a freedom to run the program. Any person or organization can use free software on any computer, for any purpose, without having to tell someone about it. But it doesn't mean that the program must be compatible with any computer or have functionality you need. It just means that you are not forbidden from making it run.
So if a program gives users all of these freedoms, it is free software. Otherwise, it is nonfree or proprietary.
# Control
Let's talk about the advantages.
With free software, it's the user who controls the software, whereas with proprietary software, the owners of the program have a power over you. And it tempts them to mistreat you. In many cases proprietary programs spy on their users, restrict what they can do with their data, and abuse them. For instance, Windows 10 automatically sends your drive encryption key to Microsoft. And also they load and execute any program on your computer through the Windows Update service without your consent.

# Free software is more reliable
Advantage number 2 is that free software is more reliable.
Barton Miller and his colleagues did scientific tests of the reliability of Unix system programs in 1990s. They tested seven proprietary Unix systems and GNU. And each time GNU was ahead of competitors.
They found that nonfree Unix systems had a failure rate from 15% to 40%. In contrast, the failure rate of GNU was only 7%.
It's not just a coincidence. There are good reasons why free software is often more reliable. Firstly, the whole community is involved in fixing problems, people not only report bugs, they also fix them and share their fixes. Secondly, when developers know that their code will be public, they try to make it as clean and simple as possible to earn a good reputation in the community.
# Free software is not perfect
But free software is not perfect. Free programs may contain bugs or lack some features. And it's normal, projects tend to become better overtime.
What's worse is that most open source projects are not what you imagine when you hear "open source", they are not like Linux or some other big projects because the average number of contributors to a free software project is one. There is no code review or any kind of collaboration in such projects. So they don't get any practical advantage over proprietary software. But at least they still give you freedom.
# What you can do
Although it is impractical to run 100% free software at the moment, you can still help us reach the ultimate goal of a world without nonfree software. Each time you reject a proprietary program in favour of its free alternative, you make a little step towards that goal. Eventually it all adds up and not only you get more freedom, you also help your whole community.
