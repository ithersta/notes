## What operating system do you prefer, and why?
Windows is by far the most popular desktop operating system, but I think that the OS must be free and open source, so I prefer Linux. In my opinion, free software is more ethical than proprietary one. In many cases proprietary programs spy on their users, restrict what they can do with their data, and abuse them.
## What is an OS and its functions?
An operating system is one of the most important parts of the computer. Almost every type of computer needs an operating system in order to operate properly.
One of the main tasks of an operating system is to control computer's resources. The OS allocates resources as necessary to ensure that each application receives the appropriate amount. In addition, operating systems provide a consistent API so the programmer does not need to know the details of underlying hardware.
## Why is Windows so popular?
I think Windows is so popular for several reasons. 
Firstly, users are familiar with it. They don't want to try anything else because Windows works well enough most of the time.
Secondly, Windows is preinstalled on most computers. Most people won't even think about installing something else.
Thirdly, Windows has a lot of software that is not available on other platforms.
## The reasons of piracy
I think there are several reasons for piracy.
Firstly, some people just want programs for free while others actually can't afford them.
Secondly, not all software can be purchased legally because it can be unavailable in your region or for some other reason.
Thirdly, some people argue that copyright shouldn't even exist because you can't steal digital goods, you just copy a sequence of ones and zeros, no one is harmed.
## Ways of solving piracy problem?
There are several ways you can solve piracy problem.
Firstly, you can try to remove pirated software from the Internet, but I don't think it's effective because people will upload it again.
In my opinion, the correct way to do it is to make it more convenient to pay than to pirate. You can also offer support or some additional services, these things can't be pirated.
