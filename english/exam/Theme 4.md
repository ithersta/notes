## What are the traits important for constituting a programming language?
What are the traits important for constituting a programming language? 
Firstly, it is a function. A programming language is used to create computer programs. 
Secondly, to express these algorithms programming languages contain constructs to define data structures or control the execution flow. 
The third trait is a target, programming languages allow humans to communicate instructions to machines. 
Finally, programming languages are classified by the computations they are capable of expressing or by their expressive power.
## What are the contexts in which programming languages are used?
Programming languages are used in a variety of contexts:
- Programs range from tiny scripts to huge systems
- Programmers range in their experience
- Programs can work on systems ranging from microcontrollers to supercomputers
## How are programming languages different from natural languages?
Programming languages require a greater degree of precision and completeness compared to natural languages. When you use a natural language, you can be ambiguous and make small errors, and still expect your intent to be understood. However, computers do exactly what they are told to do, they can't understand your intent.
